## Forecasting Product Sales 
Forecasting sales figures is an important part of any business. It allows businesses to optimize processes such as resource allocation, hiring of staff and inventory management to name a few. Having reliable sales forecast enables leaders to make data driven decisions which will impact the longevity of the business.

The task is to forecast shampoo sales. We are given 3 years worth of monthly sales (in units sold) of this particular product. We implement an **ARIMA Time Series Model** which is a one of the most popular model in the field of time series analysis.

The original dataset is credited to Makridakis, Wheelwright, and Hyndman (1998)
